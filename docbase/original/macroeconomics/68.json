{"title": "international finance and open-economy macroeconomics (springer texts in business and economics)", "content": "\n \t this rigorous textbook tames technicalities and makes even the most complex models accessible to students. its unique two-tier structure makes the book attractive for undergraduates, graduates and researchers alike. in fact, the coverage is primarily directed to undergraduate students and is mainly confined to graphic analysis and to some elementary algebra. further, each chapter has its own mathematical appendix, in which (i) the topics treated in the text are examined at a level suitable for advanced undergraduates, graduates and researchers, and (ii) generalizations and/or topics not treated in the text (including some at the cutting edge of research) are formally examined.\u00a0the new edition has been thoroughly revised and updated to reflect the latest research on international finance.this book deals with the financial side of international economics and covers all aspects of international finance. there are many books and articles by exponents of alternative points of view. i know of no other book that provides the scope, balance, objectivity and rigor of this book.  the late professor jerome l. stein, brown university  this book is a second edition of a volume on international finance first published in 2001. like giancarlo\u2019s other books in international economics, this book is organised as a two-books-in-one by distributing the material between text and appendices. the text provides coverage suitable for an undergraduate course while the mathematical appendices provide coverage of the topics at the frontier of the discipline and suitable for advanced undergraduate or graduate students in an international finance and international macroeconomics course.  this edition updates the earlier volume and covers all the classic topics as well as the more recent advances in the theory and\u00a0 modelling of international finance. it includes some discussion of the empirical testing of these theories and where appropriate reference to the extensive empirical literature is also provided.  this book is a valuable addition to the bookshelf of any serious international finance scholar and provides a treasure chest of material for any quality international finance course.  professor pasquale m sgro, deakin university  giancarlo gandolfo is one of the profession's most gifted textbook authors on mathematical modeling and international economics. his revised international finance and open-economy macroeconomics is remarkable for its scope and clarity. the book covers the older and intertemporal approaches, and topics that are usually left out of graduate treatments (the chapter on balance-of-payments accounting is a gem). gandolfo's two-tier approach of first developing topics with graphs and basic algebra and then providing rigorous mathematics for each topic makes the book ideal for advanced undergraduate and graduate classes.  professor michael d. goldberg, university of new hampshire\n \t\n "}
