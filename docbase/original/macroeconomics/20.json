{"title": "managing in a global economy: demystifying international macroeconomics (economic applications, infotrac printed...", "content": "\n \t marthinsen's managing in a global economy: demystifying international macroeconomics is written specifically for mba students and addresses important issues confronting business managers. this exciting new first edition presents macroeconomics in the context of real world decision-making, it helps students grasp practical \"big picture\" concepts, nurtures an understanding of what causes macroeconomic variables to change, and relates these changes to issues confronting managers. marthinsen integrates the three major macroeconomic sectors (i.e., the real goods market, real loanable funds market, and foreign exchange market) in a user-friendly way with a minimum of math and only supply and demand analysis. liberating readers from dry, overly complex macroeconomic models, marthinsen uses theory only as a means to an end for practical understanding. clear and concise, the book focuses on concrete business examples to show how economic shocks, such as monetary and fiscal policies or shifts in international capital flows, affect management decisions. the book was written for mbas who were not necessarily economics majors, making it appealing to students with a variety of undergraduate backgrounds. marthinsen keeps readers visually engaged with strategic use of figures, tables, charts, and illustrative exhibits. managing in a global economy offers a strategic focus, emphasizes the interaction among markets, and equips mbas with a macroeconomic perspective that will last (and be used) for years.\n \t\n "}
