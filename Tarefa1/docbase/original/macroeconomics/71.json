{"content": "\n \t in the pursuit of happiness the latest addition to the brookings focus series carol graham explores what we know about the determinants of happiness across and within countries at different stages of development she then takes a look at just what we can do with that new knowledge and clearly presents both the promise and the potential pitfalls of injecting the economics of happiness into public policymaking  this burgeoning field largely a product of collaboration between economists and psychologists is gaining great currency worldwide one of a handful of pioneers to study this topic a mere decade ago graham is understandably excited about how far the concept has come and its possible utility in the future the british french and brazilian governments already have introduced happiness metrics into their benchmarks of national progress and the us government could follow suit but happiness as a yardstick to help measure a nations wellbeing is still a relatively new approach and many questions remain unanswered  the pursuit of happiness spotlights the innovative contributions of happiness research to the dismal science but it also raises a cautionary note about the issues that still need to be addressed before policymakers can make best use of them an effective definition of wellbeing that goes beyond measuring incomethe gross national product approachcould very well lead to improved understanding of poverty and economic welfare but the question remains how best to measure and quantify happiness while scholars have developed rigorous measures of wellbeing that can be included in our statisticsas the british are already doingto what degree should we use such metrics to shape and evaluate policy particularly in assessing development outcomes  graham considers a number of unanswered questions such as whether policy should be more concerned with increasing daytoday contentment or with providing greater opportunity to build a fulfilling life other issues include whether we care more about the happiness of todays citizens or that of future generations policies such as reducing our fiscal deficits or reforming our health care system for example typically require sacrificing current consumption and immediate wellbeing for better longrun outcomes another is whether policy should focus on reducing misery or raising general levels of wellbeing beyond their relatively high levels in the same way that reducing poverty is only one choice among many objectives in our macroeconomic policy  employing the new metrics without attention to these questions could produce mistakes that might undermine the longterm prospects for a truly meaningful economics of wellbeing despite this cautionary note graham points out that it is surely a positive development that some of our public attention is going to better understanding and enhancing the wellbeing of our citizens rather than emphasizing the roots of their divide\n \t\n ", "title": "the pursuit of happiness an economy of wellbeing brookings focus books"}
