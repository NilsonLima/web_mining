{"title": "john f. kennedy: a biography", "content": "\n \t john f. kennedy creates an absorbing, insightful and distinguished biography of one of america's most legendary presidents. while current fashion in kennedy scholarship is to deride the man's achievements, this book describes kennedy's strengths, explains his shortcomings, and offers many new revelations.there are many specialized books on kennedy's career, but no first-class modern biography--one that takes advantage of the huge volume of recent books and articles and new material released by the jfk library. ten years in the making, this is a balanced and judicious profile that goes beyond the clash of interpretations and offers a fresh, nuanced perspective.\n \t\n "}
