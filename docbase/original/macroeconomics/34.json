{"title": "on the principles of political economy, and taxation", "content": "\n \t this book was originally published prior to 1923, and represents a reproduction of an important                 historical work, maintaining the same format as the original work. while some publishers have opted to                 apply ocr (optical character recognition) technology to the process, we believe this leads to                 sub-optimal results (frequent typographical errors, strange characters and confusing formatting) and                 does not adequately preserve the historical character of the original artifact. we believe this work is                 culturally important in its original archival form. while we strive to adequately clean and digitally                 enhance the original work, there are occasionally instances where imperfections such as blurred or                 missing pages, poor pictures or errant marks may have been introduced due to either the quality of the                 original work or the scanning process itself. despite these occasional imperfections, we have brought it                 back into print as part of our ongoing global book preservation commitment, providing customers with                 access to the best possible historical reprints. we appreciate your understanding of these occasional                 imperfections, and sincerely hope you enjoy seeing the book in a format as close as possible to that                 intended by the original publisher.\n \t\n "}
