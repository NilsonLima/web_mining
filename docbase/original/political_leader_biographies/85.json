{"title": "autobiography (penguin classics)", "content": "\n \t one of the greatest prodigies of his era, john stuart mill (1806-73) was studying arithmetic and greek by the age of three, as part of an astonishingly intense education at his father's hand. intellectually brilliant, fearless and profound, he became a leading victorian liberal thinker, whose works - including on liberty, utilitarianism, the subjection of women and this autobiography - are among the crowning achievements of the age. here he describes the pressures placed on him by his childhood, the mental breakdown he suffered as a young man, his struggle to understand a world of feelings and emotions far removed from his father's strict didacticism, and the later development of his own radical beliefs. a moving account of an extraordinary life, this great autobiography reveals a man of deep integrity, constantly searching for truth.for more than seventy years, penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the english-speaking world. with more than 1,700 titles, penguin classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines. readers trust the series to provide authoritative texts enhanced by introductions and notes by distinguished scholars and contemporary authors, as well as up-to-date translations by award-winning translators.\n \t\n "}
