{"title": "systemic fragility in the global economy", "content": "\n \t just as contemporary economics failed to predict the 2008-09 crash, andover-estimated the subsequent brief recovery that followed, economiststoday are again failing to accurately forecast the slowing global economicgrowth, the growing fragility, and therefore rising instability in the globaleconomy.  this book offers a new approach to explaining why mainstream economicanalyses have repeatedly failed and why fiscal and monetary policies havebeen incapable of producing a sustained recovery.expanding upon the early contributions of keynes, minsky and others, itoffers an alternative explanation why the global economy is slowing longterm and becoming more unstable, why policies to date have largely failed,and why the next crisis may therefore prove even worse than that of 2008-09.systemic fragility is rooted in 9 key empirical trends:  slowing realinvestment; a drift toward deflation; money, credit and liquidity explosion;rising levels of global debt; a shift to speculative financial investing; therestructuring of financial markets to reward capital incomes; the restrictingof labor markets to lower wage incomes; the failure of central bankmonetary policies; and the ineffectiveness of fiscal policies.it results from financial, consumer, and government balance sheetfragilities exacerbating each other -- creating a massive centripetal forcedisaggregating and tearing apart the whole, untamable by either fiscal ormonetary means.this book clarifies how the price system in general, and financial assetprices in particular, transform into fundamentally destabilizing forces underconditions of systemic fragility.  it explains why the global system has inrecent decades become dependent upon, and even addicted to, massiveliquidity injections, and how fiscal policies have been counterproductive,exacerbating fragility and instability.policymakers\u2019 failure to come to grips with how fundamental changes in thestructure of the 21st century global capitalist economy\u2015in particular infinancial and labor market structures\u2015make the global economy moresystemically fragile can only propel it toward deeper instability and crises.an appendix describes three simultaneous equations that express innotational form the variables associated with the theory of systemicfragility.\n \t\n "}
