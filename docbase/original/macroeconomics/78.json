{"title": "creating a 21st century win-win economy", "content": "\n \t this book is about political macroeconomics which is the economic discipline that studies the overall condition and behavior of a country\u2019s economy. the size of the macroeconomic pie is unlimited. the age of scarcity is over, because the current capacity and productivity of the private sector can grow and produce all the goods and services that everyone needs as long we use proper resource conservation. we just can\u2019t produce and distribute it properly! i will describe the solutions in u.s. terms, but they apply to the global economy.let me state this loud and clear: the macroeconomic systems of the world are in need of change! the proper macroeconomic philosophy will free the politicians from fighting about philosophy, and it will allow them to argue and compromise over the specifics of implementation. the debate between the 19th century laissez-faire libertarian economics and the 20th century keynesian economics has gone on long enough! both are not complete enough to create a 21st century win-win economy. i will take the most successful parts from each philosophy and add to them the proper money creation and distribution systems.the political economic debate that continually splits our country and our leaders is a vicious cycle that can be stopped. arguments over tax and spend (fiscal policy), and the so-called national debt are not the answer to our economic problems. fiscal policy was not the cause of the \u201cgreat recession,\u201d \u201cgreat depression,\u201d or any other economic downturn; therefore, it cannot be the solution!  what is the solution? i have one. the solution that i propose is nonpartisan; it is purely based on economic logic and reasoning.this book is not an exhaustive description and defense of capitalism. there are plenty of economists who have expounded on this subject.  instead, i will define capitalism and provide the structures to reduce its major flaws. the solutions will not be about zero or limited government, but the \u201cright\u201d government. one of my goals is to educate our leaders and to empower the government to be a more efficient partner so we can accomplish the necessary programs to insure our future. my answers will be based on imperfect human operations, not on nonexistent human perfections.this is not a proposal to solve all the problems of mankind, just the economic ones. the book is not a proposal for some creation of utopia or what i call \u201cla-la land\u201d.  these are solutions that i believe we should and can do now, not in the next century. this book only covers and defends with economic reasoning and history\u2014not on moral, fairness, political, community or social justice. these are valid points, but should not be used until an economic defense is presented.this is a solutions book written for the average citizen, but should be read by academics. in order for the book to be of reasonable length, it is not a typical academic book. it is not written in what i call \u201cecono-speak\u201d. i will try to keep the language easy to understand, and i will also provide a glossary. there will be mainly answers provided, with a limited amount of descriptive history, examples, footnotes, and statistics. i will refer to books and websites for you to read as a way of providing additional evidence, validation, economic reasoning and examples. unfortunately, we cannot discuss every economic problem in detail; however, a general macroeconomic roadmap for decision making and basic solutions are provided within. these solutions are neither socialistic nor utopian. there will always be human disparity, differences and conflicts. we will still fight over operational decisions but the basic macroeconomic philosophy will be established!\n \t\n "}
