{"title": "finland as a knowledge economy 2.0: lessons on policies and governance (directions in development)", "content": "\n \t finland is known for its consistent progress in the economy and competitiveness, as well as the egalitarian society underneath it. yet, the challenges experienced by finland in the beginning of the 20th century were similar to those experienced by many countries today. finland emerged as an independent nation in the midst of international economic and political turbulence. in spite of its remoteness, relative scarcity of natural resources, smallness of the home market and recent history characterized by wars and social cleavages, finland transformed itself from an agriculture-based economy in the 1950\u2019s into one of the leading innovation-driven, knowledge-based economies and high-tech producers in the twenty-first century. the development was rapid, and involved determined action and sometimes drastic decisions by the government and other key actors. today, at the end of 2013, finland is facing new types of challenges both domestically and internationally in efforts to maintain its societal sustainability and economic competitiveness.finland knowledge economy 2.0 presents some of the key policies, elements, initiatives and decisions behind finland\u2019s path into the knowledge economy of today. the authors hope to provide the readers inspiration, new ideas, and novel insights. hopefully some of the lessons learned may prove valuable in another context. based on this account of the development of finnish knowledge economy, the authors have identified six areas of lessons, each described in detail in respective chapters. the book should not be seen as a scientific all encompassing study, but rather as a \u201cknowledge economy cook-book\u201d, with practical cases, links and insights provided for further exploration.\n \t\n "}
