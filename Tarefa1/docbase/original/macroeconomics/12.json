{"content": "\n \t who was the greater economistadam smith or charles darwin the question seems absurd darwin after all was a naturalist not an economist but robert frank new york times economics columnist and bestselling author of the economic naturalist predicts that within the next century darwin will unseat smith as the intellectual founder of economics the reason frank argues is that darwins understanding of competition describes economic reality far more accurately than smiths and the consequences of this fact are profound indeed the failure to recognize that we live in darwins world rather than smiths is putting us all at risk by preventing us from seeing that competition alone will not solve our problems smiths theory of the invisible hand which says that competition channels selfinterest for the common good is probably the most widely cited argument today in favor of unbridled competitionand against regulation taxation and even government itself but what if smiths idea was almost an exception to the general rule of competition thats what frank argues resting his case on darwins insight that individual and group interests often diverge sharply far from creating a perfect world economic competition often leads to arms races encouraging behaviors that not only cause enormous harm to the group but also provide no lasting advantages for individuals since any gains tend to be relative and mutually offsetting  the good news is that we have the ability to tame the darwin economy the best solution is not to prohibit harmful behaviors but to tax them by doing so we could make the economic pie larger eliminate government debt and provide better public services all without requiring painful sacrifices from anyone thats a bold claim frank concedes but it follows directly from logic and evidence that most people already accept in a new afterword frank further explores how the themes of inequality and competition are driving todays public debate on how much government we need\n \t\n ", "title": "the darwin economy liberty competition and the common good"}
