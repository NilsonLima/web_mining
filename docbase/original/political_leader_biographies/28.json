{"title": "the gatekeepers: how the white house chiefs of staff define every presidency", "content": "\n \t the first in-depth, behind-the-scenes look at the white house chiefs of staff, whose actions\u2014and inactions\u2014have defined the course of our country. what do dick cheney and rahm emanuel have in common? aside from polarizing personalities, both served as chief of staff to the president of the united states\u2014as did donald rumsfeld, leon panetta, and a relative handful of others. the chiefs of staff, often referred to as \"the gatekeepers,\" wield tremendous power in washington and beyond; they decide who is allowed to see the president, negotiate with congress to push potus's agenda, and\u2014most crucially\u2014enjoy unparalleled access to the leader of the free world. each chief can make or break an administration, and each president reveals himself by the chief he picks.\u00a0 through extensive, intimate interviews with all seventeen\u00a0living chiefs and two former presidents, award-winning journalist and producer chris whipple pulls back the curtain on this unique fraternity. in doing so, he revises our understanding of presidential history, showing us how james baker\u2019s expert managing of the white house, the press, and capitol hill paved the way for the reagan revolution\u2014and, conversely, how watergate, the iraq war, and even the bungled obamacare rollout might\u00a0have been prevented by a more effective chief.\u00a0 filled with shrewd analysis and never-before-reported details,\u00a0the gatekeepers\u00a0offers an essential portrait of the toughest job in washington.\n \t\n "}
