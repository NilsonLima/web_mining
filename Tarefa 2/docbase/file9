Dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) studies frequently observe a fine structure in the local spectral function of the SU(2) Fermi-Hubbard model at half filling: in the metallic phase close to the Mott transition, subpeaks emerge at the inner edges of the Hubbard bands. Here we demonstrate that these subpeaks originate from the low-energy effective interaction of doublon-holon pairs, by investigating how the correlation functions of doublon and holon operators contribute to the subpeaks. DMFT calculations using the numerical renormalization group (NRG) as an impurity solver and a mean-field analysis of the low-energy effective Hamiltonian provide consistent results. In the SU(3) and SU(4) Hubbard models, the subpeaks become more pronounced due to the increased degeneracy of doublon-holon pair excitations.
