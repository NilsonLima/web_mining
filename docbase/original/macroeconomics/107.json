{"title": "modeling monetary economies", "content": "\n \t the approach of this text for upper-level undergraduates is to teach monetary economics using the classical paradigm of rational agents in a market setting. by teaching from first principles, the authors aim to instruct students not only in the monetary policies and institutions that exist today in the united states but also in what policies and institutions may or should exist tomorrow and elsewhere.  the text builds on a simple, clear monetary model and applies this framework consistently to a wide variety of monetary questions.  the authors have added in this second edition new material on speculative attacks on currencies, social security, currency boards, central banking alternatives, the payments system, and the lucas model of price surprises.  discussions of many topics have been extended, presentations of data greatly expanded, and new exercises added.\n \t\n "}
