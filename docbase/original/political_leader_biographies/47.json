{"title": "stalin: a biography", "content": "\n \t overthrowing the conventional image of stalin as an uneducated political administrator inexplicably transformed into a pathological killer, robert service reveals a more complex and fascinating story behind this notorious twentieth-century figure. drawing on unexplored archives and personal testimonies gathered from across russia and georgia, this is the first full-scale biography of the soviet dictator in twenty years.service describes in unprecedented detail the first half of stalin's life--his childhood in georgia as the son of a violent, drunkard father and a devoted mother; his education and religious training; and his political activity as a young revolutionary. no mere messenger for lenin, stalin was a prominent activist long before the russian revolution. equally compelling is the depiction of stalin as soviet leader. service recasts the image of stalin as unimpeded despot; his control was not limitless. and his conviction that enemies surrounded him was not entirely unfounded.stalin was not just a vengeful dictator but also a man fascinated by ideas and a voracious reader of marxist doctrine and russian and georgian literature as well as an internationalist committed to seeing russia assume a powerful role on the world stage. in examining the multidimensional legacy of stalin, service helps explain why later would-be reformers--such as khrushchev and gorbachev--found the stalinist legacy surprisingly hard to dislodge. rather than diminishing the horrors of stalinism, this is an account all the more disturbing for presenting a believable human portrait. service's lifetime engagement with soviet russia has resulted in the most comprehensive and compelling portrayal of stalin to date.\n \t\n "}
